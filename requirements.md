## MVP

An MVP would allow the user to go to five locations, where they can find a Rezzy fossil, the location having a fluctuating probability. Each Rezzy creature has a fixed probability. Users will be able to chart out their bag holdings. Next to each Rezzy, the user can see the chances of finding it and its scarcity ranking. Once found, users can see the detailed information on the Rezzy, along with a scientific fact.
